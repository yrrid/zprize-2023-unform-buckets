This directory contains the java code we used to test out the twisted edwards equations.

To try the software run:
   javac *.java
   java tester
   
The tester runs a sequence of point additions both in Short Weierstrass form and in Twisted
Edwards form.  Then it converts the results to check to make sure they match.  

As was noted in the BLS12377 twisted edwards solution submitted by hardcaml in the 2022
ZPrize, there are 5 points that satisfy the curve equation that can not be from Short Weierstrass
form to Twisted Edwards form.  Here we present all 5 points:

  pt1 = (x, y) = (0x17b62f01197dc4c6cf996f256d489ac9333ccbfe8c0adeaef1096c9bdf2e3d8e89faab521e38583e9033db52f6523ff, 
                  0x07d6ff5c7338b952b42317a0f6cc62ed2695adb23e585fc0ac765e8156ff4c12780ac5b0abb46589612e0b472e93b5f)
                  
  pt2 = (x, y) = (0x17b62f01197dc4c6cf996f256d489ac9333ccbfe8c0adeaef1096c9bdf2e3d8e89faab521e38583e9033db52f6523ff,
                  0x130ca50509185559af8d4465d34830c47b97f17dd0f8d93142bfc47a499533eef8ab0e92544b9a7eef5df4b8d16c4a2)
                  
  pt3 = (x, y) = (0x1ae3a4617c510eac63b05c06ca1493b1a22d9f300f5138f1ef3622fba094800170b5d44300000008508c00000000000, 0x0)
  
  pt4 = (x, y) = (0x9b3af05dd14f6ec619aaf7d34594aabc5ed1347970dec00452217cc900000008508c00000000002, 0x0)
  
  pt5 = (x, y) = (0x1ae3a4617c510eabc8756ba8f8c524eb8882a75cc9bc8e359064ee822fb5bffd1e94577a00000000000000000000000, 0x0)

The tester code check the following properties of each of the 5 points:

   1)  The point satisfied the curve equation  --   y^2 = x^3 + 1
   2)  The Mapping from Short Weierstrass form to twisted edwards form fails
   3)  Given P=(x, y) check P^K!=Infinity, where K is the curve order (0x12ab655e9a2ca55660b44d1e5c37b00159aa76fed00000010a11800000000001). 
   
The last property is especially important.  Since all points, P, where P <- G1, have the property that P^K==Infinity, and since
none of the 5 points that can't be mapped have that property, we can be sure that none of the 5 points are in G1.  Therefore we
never have to worry about special treatment of those 5 points, or that we'll hit one of the points in a bucket sum computation.

In other words, it's completely safe for us to use the translation to Twisted Edwards space.  This hadn't been shown by hardcaml.
